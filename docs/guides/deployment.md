## Deployment Overview

[Project Name] is designed for deployment on [Your Deployment Choice] with automated CI/CD pipelines.

## Deployment Environments

### Development

- **URL**: [dev-url]
- **Purpose**: Feature development and testing
- **Auto-deploy**: On push to `develop` branch

### Staging

- **URL**: [staging-url]
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing
- **Auto-deploy**: On push to `staging` branch

### Production

- **URL**: [production-url]
- **Purpose**: Live application
- **Auto-deploy**: On push to `main` branch

## Deployment Process

### 1. Pre-deployment Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migrations ready
- [ ] Performance testing completed

### 2. Automated Deployment

The deployment process is fully automated through CI/CD:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, staging, develop]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to [Platform]
        # Deployment steps
```

### 3. Manual Deployment (if needed)

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy to [Platform]
[deployment-command]
```

## Environment Configuration

### Production Environment Variables

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="[production-database-url]"
DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN="[production-auth-token]"

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="[production-secret]"
NEXTAUTH_URL="[production-url]"

# External Services
[EXTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY]="[production-api-key]"
[EXTERNAL_SERVICE_SECRET]="[production-secret]"

# Feature Flags
ENABLE_[FEATURE]="true"
```

### Environment-Specific Configurations

- **Development**: Local development settings
- **Staging**: Production-like testing environment
- **Production**: Optimized production settings

## Monitoring & Observability

### Health Checks

- **Application Health**: `[url]/api/health`
- **Database Health**: `[url]/api/health/db`
- **External Services**: `[url]/api/health/external`

### Performance Monitoring

- **Response Times**: [Your monitoring tool]
- **Error Rates**: [Your error tracking tool]
- **User Experience**: [Your UX monitoring tool]

### Logging

- **Application Logs**: [Your logging service]
- **Access Logs**: [Your access logging]
- **Error Logs**: [Your error logging]

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback

If deployment fails, the system automatically rolls back to the previous version.

### Manual Rollback

```bash
# Rollback to previous version
[rollback-command]

# Verify rollback
[verification-command]
```

## Security Considerations

### SSL/TLS

- **Certificate**: [Your SSL provider]
- **Auto-renewal**: [Your renewal process]
- **Security Headers**: [Your security configuration]

### Access Control

- **Deployment Access**: [Who can deploy]
- **Environment Access**: [Who can access environments]
- **Monitoring Access**: [Who can view monitoring]

## Post-Deployment

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] Application loads correctly
- [ ] All features working
- [ ] Performance metrics normal
- [ ] Error rates acceptable
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured

### Monitoring Setup

- [ ] Set up performance alerts
- [ ] Configure error notifications
- [ ] Set up user experience monitoring
- [ ] Test monitoring systems

## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

#### Build Failures

- Check build logs for errors
- Verify all dependencies are available
- Check environment variable configuration

#### Runtime Errors

- Check application logs
- Verify database connectivity
- Check external service availability

#### Performance Issues
