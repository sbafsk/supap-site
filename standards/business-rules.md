  const required = businessRules.requiredFields[process.step] || []
  required.forEach((field) => {
    if (!process[field]) {
      errors.push(`${field} is required for ${process.step} step`)
    }
  })

  // Check valid transitions
  const currentStep = process.step
  const allowedTransitions = businessRules.transitions[currentStep] || []
  if (process.nextStep && !allowedTransitions.includes(process.nextStep)) {
    errors.push(`Invalid transition from ${currentStep} to ${process.nextStep}`)
  }

  return {
    isValid: errors.length === 0,
    errors,
  }
}
```

### [Domain 2] Rules

#### Pricing Rules

```typescript
interface PricingRule {
  basePrice: number
  discountPercentage: number
  minimumQuantity: number
  maximumDiscount: number
}

const calculatePrice = (rule: PricingRule, quantity: number): number => {
  let finalPrice = rule.basePrice * quantity

  // Apply quantity discount
  if (quantity >= rule.minimumQuantity) {
    const discount = (rule.discountPercentage / 100) * finalPrice
    const maxDiscount = (rule.maximumDiscount / 100) * finalPrice
    finalPrice -= Math.min(discount, maxDiscount)
  }

  return Math.max(finalPrice, 0) // Ensure non-negative price
}
```

    public context: Record<string, any>
  ) {
    super(message)
    this.name = "BusinessRuleViolation"

  ) {

    this.name = "ValidationError"
  }
}
```

#### Exception Handling Strategy

```typescript
const handleBusinessException = (error: Error): void => {
  if (error instanceof BusinessRuleViolation) {
    // Log business rule violation
    logger.warn("Business rule violated", {
      rule: error.rule,
      context: error.context,
    })

    // Notify relevant stakeholders
    notifyStakeholders(error)
  } else if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
    // Handle validation errors
    logger.error("Validation failed", {
      field: error.field,
      value: error.value,
    })
  } else {
    // Handle unexpected errors
    logger.error("Unexpected error", { error: error.message })
  }
}
```

## Rule Enforcement

### Implementation Methods

#### Database Constraints

```sql
-- Example: Ensure positive prices
ALTER TABLE products ADD CONSTRAINT positive_price CHECK (price > 0);

-- Example: Ensure unique emails
ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email UNIQUE (email);

-- Example: Ensure valid status transitions
ALTER TABLE orders ADD CONSTRAINT valid_status_transition
CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'shipped', 'delivered'));
```

#### Application-Level Validation

```typescript
const validateBusinessRules = (data: any): ValidationResult => {
  const errors: string[] = []

  // Apply business rules
  if (data.price && data.price <= 0) {
    errors.push("Price must be positive")
  }

  if (data.email && !isValidEmail(data.email)) {
    errors.push("Invalid email format")
  }

  // Apply domain-specific rules
  if (data.type === "premium" && data.price < 100) {
    errors.push("Premium items must cost at least $100")
  }

  return {
    isValid: errors.length === 0,
    errors,
  }
}
```
